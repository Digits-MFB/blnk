## Getting Started with Blnk

### Docker Deployment

Get Blnk up and running with minimal setup using Docker:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/blnk.json:/blnk.json -p 5001:5001 jerryenebeli/blnk:latest
```

This command ensures your configuration file is used by the Blnk server, making deployment a breeze.

### Building from Source

For those who prefer a hands-on approach or need customizations:

1. Ensure you have Go (version 1.16 or newer): Visit [Go's official site](https://golang.org/doc/install) for installation guides.
2. Clone and build Blnk:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jerry-enebeli/Blnk && cd Blnk
make build
```

### Configuration Essentials

#### The `blnk.json` Configuration File

To tailor Blnk to your needs, create a `blnk.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "project_name": "Blnk",
  "time_zone": "UTC",
  "data_source": {
    "dns": "postgres://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=disable"
  },
  "redis": {
    "dns": "redis://host:port"
  },
  "account_number_generation": {
    "enable_auto_generation": true,
    "http_service": {
      "url": "http://your-service/mocked-account",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your_auth_token"
      }
    }
  },
  "server": {
    "domain": "yourdomain.com",
    "ssl": false,
    "ssl_email": "your@email.com",
    "port": "5001"
  },
  "notification": {
    "slack": {
      "webhook_url": "http://your-slack-webhook.com"
    },
    "webhook": {
      "url": "http://your-webhook-url.com",
      "headers": {}
    }
  }
}

```

Ensure you replace placeholders (e.g., `username`, `password`) with your actual database credentials.
